# VamaTestApp

## Description

TerminalApp written in kotlin, using clean architecture, modularization, MVVM, Realm database and Dagger as di.

What is implemented:
- code refactored using clean architecture.
- fix found bugs.
- implement new user transactions feature.

What I prefer to implement if there were more time
- I would prefer to refactor ui part using Jetpack Compose.
- I would prefer to setup custom text watcher rather than masked Edit text.
- I would prefer to add missing UnitTests
